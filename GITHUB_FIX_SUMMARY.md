# GitHub Integration Fix - Complete Summary

## Problem
Git repository activity (commits, branches, contributors) was not being fetched in Judge Panel and Participant Panel. All stats showed as empty or 0.

## Root Cause
**Vite only exposes environment variables that start with `VITE_` to the frontend.**

Your Render environment had:
- `GITHUB_OWNER` ‚ùå (frontend can't access)
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` ‚ùå (frontend can't access)

But frontend code was looking for:
- `VITE_GITHUB_OWNER` ‚úì (Vite convention)
- `VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN` ‚úì (Vite convention)

Result: Frontend had empty credentials ‚Üí GitHub API calls failed ‚Üí No data displayed

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Code Changes ‚úÖ

**File: `src/hooks/useGitHubData.ts`**
- Added fallback logic to try both `VITE_` and non-prefixed variables
- Added comprehensive console logging for debugging
- Fixed hardcoded `commits: 0` bug (now uses actual count)
- Added token validation on component mount

**File: `src/pages/JudgePanel.tsx`**
- Updated to use fallback logic for environment variables

**File: `src/pages/ParticipantPanel.tsx`**
- Updated to use fallback logic for environment variables

**File: `server/server.js`**
- Added `/debug/env` endpoint to check environment variables
- Helps diagnose configuration issues

**File: `render.yaml`**
- Added GitHub variables to configuration

### 2. What You Need to Do üîß

**In Render Dashboard:**

1. Go to your service settings
2. Go to **Environment** section
3. Add these 4 variables:
   - `VITE_GITHUB_OWNER` = `hackabhigna2025-hub`
   - `VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN` = `ghp_8aFXxU8itsTogDqOBuWnU2fZvP3W02nUpW5`
   - `GITHUB_OWNER` = `hackabhigna2025-hub`
   - `GITHUB_TOKEN` = `ghp_8aFXxU8itsTogDqOBuWnU2fZvP3W02nUpW5`

4. Click **Manual Deploy**
5. Wait for build to complete

### 3. How to Verify ‚úì

**Check Backend:**
```
https://hackabhigna-hub.onrender.com/debug/env
```
Should show all GitHub variables as "‚úì Set"

**Check Frontend:**
1. Open app in browser
2. Press F12 ‚Üí Console
3. Look for:
   - `‚úì GitHub token configured: ghp_8aFXxU...`
   - `‚úì GitHub owner configured: hackabhigna2025-hub`

**Test Functionality:**
1. Go to Judge Panel or Participant Panel
2. Select a team
3. Click "Refresh" button
4. Commits, branches, contributors should appear

## Key Concepts

### Why VITE_ Prefix?
- Vite is a build tool that bundles frontend code
- It only exposes environment variables with `VITE_` prefix to the browser
- This is a security feature to prevent accidental exposure of secrets
- Backend (Node.js) doesn't have this restriction

### How It Works Now
1. Frontend tries `VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN` first
2. Falls back to `GITHUB_TOKEN` if not found
3. Same for owner variables
4. Logs which variable is being used
5. Makes GitHub API calls with the token

## Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "GitHub token NOT configured" | Add VITE_ variables to Render |
| "GitHub API error: 401" | Token is invalid/expired, regenerate |
| "GitHub API error: 404" | Repository doesn't exist, check owner |
| Still empty after setup | Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R), clear cache |

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Code changes are done
2. ‚è≥ Add environment variables to Render (YOU DO THIS)
3. ‚è≥ Trigger redeploy
4. ‚è≥ Verify using `/debug/env` endpoint
5. ‚è≥ Test in Judge/Participant Panel

**The fix is ready - just need to configure Render!**
