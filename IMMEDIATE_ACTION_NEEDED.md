# ‚ö†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED

## Current Status
‚úÖ Environment variables added to Render
‚ùå Deployment NOT updated yet
‚ùå Frontend still showing "GitHub token NOT configured"

## What You Need to Do RIGHT NOW

### Step 1: Trigger Redeploy in Render

1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Select your service (hackabhigna-backend)
3. Go to **Deployments** tab
4. Click **"Manual Deploy"** button
5. Wait for build to complete (2-5 minutes)

**Important:** Just adding environment variables is NOT enough. You must trigger a redeploy for the changes to take effect.

### Step 2: Wait for Deployment

The deployment will:
- Pull the latest code
- Build the application
- Start the service with new environment variables
- Make them available to the frontend

This usually takes 2-5 minutes.

### Step 3: Verify After Deployment

Once deployment is complete:

1. **Check backend:**
   - Open: `https://hackabhigna-hub.onrender.com/debug/env`
   - Should show all GitHub variables as "‚úì Set"

2. **Check frontend:**
   - Open your app
   - Press F12 ‚Üí Console
   - Should show: `‚úì GitHub token configured: ghp_8aFXxU...`

3. **Test functionality:**
   - Go to Judge Panel
   - Select a team
   - Click "Refresh"
   - Commits should appear

## Why This Is Happening

When you add environment variables to Render:
1. ‚úÖ They are saved in Render's configuration
2. ‚ùå But the running service doesn't know about them yet
3. ‚úÖ You must trigger a redeploy to apply them

The redeploy will:
- Stop the current service
- Start a new instance with the new variables
- Make them available to the frontend build

## Current Errors Explained

```
‚úó GitHub token NOT configured - GitHub API calls will fail
‚úó Make sure VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN is set in environment variables
```

This means:
- The frontend is running the OLD build (before variables were added)
- The new build hasn't been deployed yet
- Once you redeploy, these errors will go away

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] Go to Render Dashboard
- [ ] Select your service
- [ ] Go to Deployments tab
- [ ] Click "Manual Deploy"
- [ ] Wait for build to complete
- [ ] Check `/debug/env` endpoint
- [ ] Check browser console
- [ ] Test by selecting a team and clicking Refresh

## Estimated Time

- Redeploy: 2-5 minutes
- Verification: 1-2 minutes
- **Total: 5-10 minutes**
